### The Home Page

The main page of the web application and most likely the first page a would-be reader visits. Here, a blogger can try and
catch the eye of their readers, and hope that they continue on and visit more of the website. In this template, this page
is not only consisted of the background seen below, but also an image carousel (**not seen below**) that displays the most recent blogs, an easy
way for readers to visit the blogs.
