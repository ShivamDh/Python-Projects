# My First Django Project: A Blog!

After some great learning and growth in Django, I decided to create an easy to use Django blog to help apply what I had learned and perhaps provide a template for any potential blogger.The backend data storage is managed by SqLite while the front-end was built using Bootstrap. Jinja Templating also allowed for easy to use and modular HTML code to re-use.

## Below are some screenshots from the web app

This is the main landing page or home screen:

This page is displays all the blogs available to view:

Clicking on a specific blog opens a larger view to see more details:

A nice about page to view more about the author:
