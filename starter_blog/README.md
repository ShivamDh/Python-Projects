# My First Django Project: A Blog!

After some great learning and growth in my Django skills, I decided to create an easy to use
Django blog. By utilizing Django's ready-to-use backend along with seamless design and high-level
capabilities, I am able to create a nice and easy blog website.

### Details: Used Django version 1.11.3, Python 3.6, Bootstrap 3.3.7
