# My Python Projects

This repository is a collection of some of the python scripts that I have wrote over while learning Python. By learning python and at the same time applying that knowledge to real projects, I am hoping to advance my scripting skills and expertise in Python.

I am still in the process of completing and uploading some projects, but feel free to have a look around
