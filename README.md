# My Python Projects

This repository is a collection of some of the python scripts that I have wrote over while learning Python. By learning python and at the same time applying that knowledge to real projects, I am hoping to advance my scripting skills and expertise in Python.

### Trip Weather
A small little Python script I wrote that incorporates multiple 3rd party APIs to give accurate weather readings for various locations of a trip entered by the user. Comes with many user selections such as current/forecasted weather, specific weather readings, how many readings to be seen for a trip, etc.

I am still in the process of completing and uploading some projects, but feel free to have a look around
