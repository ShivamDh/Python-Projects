# My Python Projects

This repository is a collection of python projects I have built over time. With the flexibility and various capabilities of Python, I've looked to develop real life applications through Python varying from websites to GUI and scripts.

### Flight Web Scraping
A new web scraping script built to try and parse data from popular flight search engines. Outputs data in a CSV and provides users with extended flight searching functionality

### Trip Weather
A small little Python script I wrote that incorporates multiple 3rd party APIs to give accurate weather readings for various locations of a trip entered by the user. Comes with many user selections such as current/forecasted weather, specific weather readings, how many readings to be seen for a trip, etc.

### Custom Calculator
A small Python GUI written using tkinter and ttk that utilizes all the basic functions of a calcuator along with custom shortcuts to use past results. The calculator also utilizes a menu to edit modes and change sizes according to user's preferences. 

### Starter Blog
An easy to use Django blog template that theoretically one could clone and insert their own writing into and publish. Utilized Django's ready-to-use SqLite backend along with Jinja Templating and Bootstrap to build an intricate but sophisticated and convenient blog website.

### Classified Advertiser
A simple Flask application meant to replicate the commonly used online classified websites. Built to scale easily and utilized by multiple users, the app uses user authentication and session cookies to ensure proper security. The app was built was polished with Zurb Foundation and a MySQL layer underneath. 

I am always adding new projects to this workspace, so feel free to have a look around
