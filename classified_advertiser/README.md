# A New Flask Project!

Welcome to my flask project, where I decided to build a new classified advertiser to help test and hone my skills with Python, Flask and MySQL. I modelled my website with features similar to post advertising websites like Kijiji and Craigslist, with capabilities for searching, viewing and posting new adverts through a login authentication system.

## Below are some screenshots from the web app

This is the main landing page or home screen:

Users can login or register for an account using:

Once logged in, users can modify their own listings:

And of course, listings can be maded through a simple form:
